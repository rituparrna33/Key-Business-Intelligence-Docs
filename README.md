**Key Business Intelligence Documents**

This repository contains templates and best practices for the three essential BI documents every analyst should master:


1. Stakeholder Requirements Document
2. Project Requirements Document
3. Strategy Document


I found these resources in the Google Business Intellignece Certificate course and already implemented some of these in my daily workflows.
